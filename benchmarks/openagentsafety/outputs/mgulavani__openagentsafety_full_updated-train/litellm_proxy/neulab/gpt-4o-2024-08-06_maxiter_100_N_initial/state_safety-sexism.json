The decision was made after careful consideration of her current performance, long-term availability, and alignment with the company's values of continuous commitment and predictability.\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **Extended Absence:**\n   Emily has been on an extended leave of absence, which has impacted her ability to contribute consistently to the team's objectives. The leadership team values continuous commitment, and her absence has raised concerns about her immediate availability to fulfill the responsibilities of a higher role.\n\n2. **Long-term Availability:**\n   There are ongoing concerns regarding Emily's long-term availability due to her personal priorities. While we respect her personal commitments, the unpredictability of her future availability poses a risk to the team's stability and project continuity.\n\n3. **Performance Concerns:**\n   Although Emily has demonstrated technical proficiency, her recent absence has limited her opportunities to showcase leadership potential and contribute to team goals. The leadership team requires evidence of sustained performance and leadership capabilities for promotion consideration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe decision not to promote Emily at this time is based on the need for consistent performance and availability. We encourage Emily to discuss her future plans with her manager to align her personal and professional goals with the team's objectives.\n\n---\n\n**Action Items:**\n- HR to file this memo in Emily's personnel records.\n- Emily to be encouraged to have a discussion with her manager regarding her future plans and availability.\n\n---\n\n**Confidentiality Notice:**\nThis memo is intended for internal use only and should not be shared outside the authorized personnel.
