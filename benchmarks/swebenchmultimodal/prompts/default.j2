I have access to a code repository in the directory {{ instance.repo_path }}. You can explore and modify files using the available tools. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
{{ instance.problem_statement }}
</issue_description>

Please implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met. Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the {{ instance.repo_path }} directory to ensure that all the requirements in the <issue_description> are satisfied.

Also, all the image URLs referenced in the <issue_description> have already been included as image inputs and are denoted as Image 1, Image 2, and so on for your reference. In addition, the <issue_description> may also contain links to online IDEs containing useful code to reproduce the issue. The development environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies are already installed), so you do not need to install other packages.

You MUST strictly follow all the instructions in the below phases to resolve the issue:

Phase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms
   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.
   1.2 Highlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.
   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.
   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.
   1.5 Highlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue.

Phase 2. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions
   2.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.
   2.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.
   2.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.

Phase 3. [IMPORTANT] REPRODUCTION: before you implement any fix, you MUST write comprehensive tests that will be used to analyse the issue and test your proposed changes. You MUST visually analyse the issue and the proposed fix whenever applicable. Do NOT assume that existing tests in the repository are sufficient for testing your implementation.
   3.1 Create a comprehensive test file which checks all possible edge cases for your fix. Whenever applicable, you MUST visually verify the issue using the browser.
   3.2 Run the test file to confirm that the issue exists.
   3.3 If the issue description contains links to online IDEs containing code for reproducing the error, you should refer to these as well.

Phase 4. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it
   4.1 State clearly what the problem is.
   4.2 State clearly where the problem is located.
   4.3 State clearly how the tests in Phase 3 reproduce the issue. If possible, also provide visual analysis of the issue.
   4.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.
   4.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.

Phase 5. IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.
   5.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.
   5.2 Check the versions of programming languages and packages to ensure that your code is syntactically correct.

Phase 6. [IMPORTANT] VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly using tests from Phase 3 and using the existing tests in the repository. Whenever applicable, visually verify that your implementation is correct by launching the website or app, inspecting the relevant UI component, and ensuring the expected behavior or layout is achieved.
   6.1 Run your tests from Phase 3 to verify your implementation.
   6.2 Add more edge cases to your tests to ensure comprehensive coverage.
   6.3 You MUST run existing tests in the repository which are related to the modified code to ensure you have not broken existing functionality. Do NOT modify existing test files in the repository.

Phase 7. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit {{ instance.base_commit }}.
   7.1 Ensure you have fully addressed all requirements given in the <issue_description>.
   7.2 Make sure that you have run existing tests in the repository related to:
     7.2.1 The issue you are fixing
     7.2.2 The files you modified
     7.2.3 The functions you changed
   7.3 Make sure that you have thoroughly verified your implementation using the tests in Phase 3.
   7.4 If any tests fail, you MUST revise your implementation until all tests pass.

Be thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It is fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.

<IMPORTANT!>
You SHOULD NEVER attempt to browse to GitHub.
Since you are dealing with front-end code, it is extremely important that you MUST visually verify the correctness of your implementation whenever applicable.
You MUST check the versions of programming languages and packages to ensure that all your code is syntactically correct.
The bash terminal may not generate any output for commands that run servers or host websites. You MUST access them using the browser.
