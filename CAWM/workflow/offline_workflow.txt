Workflow 1: Locate Relevant Code in Codebase
Description: Use this workflow when you need to locate the relevant code in the codebase that might be causing the issue.
To find the relevant code, I need to search for files in the codebase that match the search pattern.
cd {repo} && find . -type f -name "*.py" | grep -E "{search_pattern}" | head -20
To narrow down the search, I need to find the specific class or function that might be causing the issue.
cd {repo} && grep -r "class {class_name}" --include="*.py"

Workflow 2: Fix and Verify
Description: Use this workflow when you have made a potential fix and need to verify it.
To verify the fix, I need to run the code with a test file.
cd {repo} && source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate testbed && python {test_file}
To ensure the fix doesn't break anything else, I need to run the existing test suite.
cd {repo} && source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate testbed && python -m pytest {existing_test_file} -v

Workflow 3: Create Regression Test
Description: Use this workflow when you need to create a regression test to ensure the issue doesn't reoccur.
To ensure the issue doesn't reoccur, I need to create a regression test file.
[create] {repo}/{regression_test_file}
To ensure the regression test works, I need to run it.
cd {repo} && source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate testbed && python -m pytest {regression_test_file} -v

Workflow 4: Run Specific Test Cases
Description: Use this workflow when you need to run specific test cases to verify the fix.
To ensure the fix works for specific cases, I need to run specific test cases inline.
cd {repo} && source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate testbed && python -c "{test_case_code}"
To ensure the fix doesn't break anything else, I need to run the existing test suite.
cd {repo} && source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate testbed && python -m pytest {existing_test_file} -v
