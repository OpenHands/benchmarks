The import is already there and the fix is correctly implemented.\n\n## Summary\n\nI have successfully implemented the fix for the issue where `--recursive=y` ignores `ignore-paths` configuration. Here's what I did:\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe issue was that when using `--recursive=y`, pylint's `_discover_files` method in `/tmp/tmpzjbsm4s3/pylint/pylint/lint/pylinter.py` was yielding individual Python files without checking them against the `ignore-paths` patterns. Only directories were being checked for ignore patterns, not individual files.\n\n### Solution Implemented\nI modified the `_discover_files` method in `/tmp/tmpzjbsm4s3/pylint/pylint/lint/pylinter.py` at lines 613-623 to add a check for individual files using the existing `_is_ignored_file` function:\n\n```python\nelse:\n    yield from (\n        os.path.join(root, file)\n        for file in files\n        if file.endswith(\".py\")\n        and not _is_ignored_file(\n            os.path.join(root, file),\n            self.config.ignore,\n            self.config.ignore_patterns,\n            self.config.ignore_paths,\n        )\n    )\n```\n\n### Key Changes\n1. **Single file modification**: Only modified `/tmp/tmpzjbsm4s3/pylint/pylint/lint/pylinter.py`\n2. **Minimal change**: Added just 6 lines to check individual files against ignore patterns\n3. **Reused existing functionality**: Used the existing `_is_ignored_file` function that was already imported\n4. **Maintained consistency**: Applied the same ignore logic that was already used for directories\n\n### Testing Results\nThe fix has been thoroughly tested and verified:\n\n1. **Original issue test**: \u2705 Files matching `^src/gen/.*$` are now properly ignored with `--recursive=y`\n2. **Comprehensive test**: \u2705 Regular files are still analyzed, ignored files are properly skipped\n3. **Edge cases test**: \u2705 Multiple ignore patterns work correctly\n4. **Backward compatibility**: \u2705 Non-recursive mode continues to work as before\n5. **Function-level tests**: \u2705 The `_is_ignored_file` function works correctly\n\n### Verification\n- The fix resolves the exact issue described in the bug report\n- Files in `src/gen/` directory are now properly ignored when using `--recursive=y` with the pattern `^src/gen/.*$`\n- Regular files continue to be analyzed as expected\n- The solution is minimal and focused, affecting only the specific problem area\n- No existing functionality is broken\n\nThe implementation successfully addresses the issue where `--recursive=y` was ignoring the `ignore-paths` configuration from `pyproject.toml`."}], "action": {"kind": "FinishAction",

Key Benefits\n- **Minimal change**: Only 6 lines added to fix the issue\n- **Reuses existing code**: Uses the already-imported `_is_ignored_file` function\n- **Maintains consistency**: Applies the same ignore logic used elsewhere\n- **Backward compatible**: Non-recursive mode continues to work unchanged\n\n## Testing Results\n\u2705 **Original issue resolved**: Files matching `^src/gen/.*$` are
