Currently, when a structured numpy array (with len(data.dtype) > 1) is added to a Table, it gets automatically converted to NdarrayMixin\n2. This auto-transformation was originally needed because structured dtype Column didn't work well, especially for serialization\n3. After #12644, this auto-transformation may no longer be necessary or desirable\n4. The maintainers want to deprecate this behavior and require users to explicitly wrap their data in Column objects\n\n**Problem Location:**\n- File: `/tmp/tmp3vua9gmc/astropy/astropy/table/table.py`\n- Function: `_convert_data_to_col` (lines ~1244-1247)\n- Specific code:\n```python\nif (not isinstance(data, Column) and not data_is_mixin\n        and isinstance(data, np.ndarray) and len(data.dtype) > 1):\n    data = data.view(NdarrayMixin)\n    data_is_mixin = True\n```\n\n**How the Test Reproduces the Issue:**\nThe test creates a structured numpy array and adds it to a Table. Currently, this triggers the auto-transformation without any warning to the user.\n\n**Best Practices for the Fix:**\n1. Add a FutureWarning to inform users about the upcoming change\n2. Maintain backward compatibility for now (still do the transformation)\n3. The warning should guide users to explicitly wrap their data in Column\n4. Use clear, actionable warning message\n5. Import warnings module (already imported in the file)\n\n**How to Fix the Problem:**\n1. Add a FutureWarning before the auto-transformation\n2. The warning message should:\n   - Explain what's happening (auto-transformation)\n   - Explain what will change in the future (version 5.2)\n   - Tell users how to fix their code (wrap in Column)\n3. Keep the existing transformation logic for backward compatibility\n4.
