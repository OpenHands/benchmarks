When the left operand was a `Quantity` with different units than the duck-typed array, the `Quantity.__array_ufunc__()` method would raise a `ValueError` instead of returning `NotImplemented`, preventing the duck-typed array from handling the operation via its own `__array_ufunc__` method.\n\n### Solution Implemented\nI modified the `__array_ufunc__` method in `/tmp/tmp8oam9r6h/astropy/astropy/units/quantity.py` (lines 670-682) to:\n\n1. **Wrap converter calls in try-except blocks** to catch `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions\n2. **Check for specific conversion errors** using string matching for \"not scalar compatible\" or \"convertible\" \n3. **Return `NotImplemented`** when these specific conversion errors occur, allowing duck-typed arrays to handle the operation\n4. **Re-raise other exceptions** to preserve legitimate unit conversion errors and other important error conditions\n\n### Key Features of the Fix\n- **Follows numpy array protocol**: Returns `NotImplemented` when the operation cannot be handled, as specified in numpy documentation\n- **Preserves backward compatibility**: Valid operations continue to work exactly as before\n- **Maintains error handling**: Legitimate unit conversion errors (like incompatible dimensions) are still properly raised\n- **Enables duck typing**: Allows properly implemented duck-typed arrays to handle operations when `Quantity` cannot\n\n### Verification\nThe fix was thoroughly tested with:\n1. **Original issue reproduction**: Confirmed the exact scenario from the GitHub issue now works\n2. **Edge case testing**: Verified that valid operations still work correctly\n3. **Error propagation testing**: Ensured legitimate errors are still raised appropriately\n4. **Integration testing**: Confirmed duck-typed arrays can properly handle operations\n\nThe implementation successfully resolves the issue while maintaining all existing functionality and following best practices for the numpy array protocol."}, "action_id": "4ce02be2-c85a-42bb-89fc-1bb726f7fd1c"}
