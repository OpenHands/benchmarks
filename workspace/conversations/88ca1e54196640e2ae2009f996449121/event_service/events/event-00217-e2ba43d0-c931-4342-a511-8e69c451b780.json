The problem was that expressions like `A - A*B - B` were printing as `(-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A` instead of using proper subtraction notation.\n\n## Changes Made\n\nI modified the `_print_MatAdd` methods in three printer classes:\n\n1. **String Printer** (`sympy/printing/str.py`)\n2. **LaTeX Printer** (`sympy/printing/latex.py`) \n3. **Pretty Printer** (`sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`)\n\n## Key Technical Solution\n\nThe core issue was that the existing `_coeff_isneg()` function only worked for regular `Mul` objects, but MatrixSymbol expressions use `MatMul` objects. I implemented:\n\n- `_mat_coeff_isneg()`: Detects negative coefficients in both `Mul` and `MatMul` objects\n- `_get_positive_term()`: Extracts the positive version of negative terms without creating double negatives\n\n## Results\n\n**Before fix:**\n```\nstr():    (-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A\npprint(): -B + -A\u22c5B + A\nlatex():  '-1 B + -1 A B + A'\n```\n\n**After fix:**\n```\nstr():    -B - A*B + A\npprint(): -B - A\u22c5B + A  \nlatex():  -B - A B + A\n```\n\nThe fix successfully eliminates the `(-1)*` notation and uses proper subtraction signs, making MatrixSymbol expressions much more readable and consistent with regular symbol behavior. All three printers (str, pretty, latex) now work correctly, and existing functionality for regular symbols remains unchanged."}, "action_id": "3e1d84bb-3efe-46cf-b2f0-7fa387e4b90c"}
