The issue has been completely resolved. Let me summarize what was accomplished:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI successfully fixed the MatrixSymbol subtraction printing issue by modifying the `_print_MatAdd` methods in three printer classes:\n\n### 1. **String Printer** (`sympy/printing/str.py`)\n- Added `_mat_coeff_isneg()` helper function to detect negative coefficients in MatMul expressions\n- Added `_get_positive_term()` helper function to extract the positive version of negative terms\n- Modified `_print_MatAdd()` to use proper subtraction notation instead of `(-1)*` coefficients\n\n### 2. **LaTeX Printer** (`sympy/printing/latex.py`)\n- Added the same helper functions as the string printer\n- Modified `_print_MatAdd()` to handle negative first terms correctly\n- Ensured proper LaTeX subtraction notation\n\n### 3. **Pretty Printer** (`sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`)\n- Added the same helper functions as the other printers\n- Modified `_print_MatAdd()` to use the `_get_positive_term()` function instead of simple negation\n- Maintained proper pretty printing format with minus signs\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\nThe core issue was that the existing `_coeff_isneg()` function only worked for regular `Mul` objects, but MatrixSymbol expressions use `MatMul` objects. The solution involved:\n\n1. **Detection**: Created `_mat_coeff_isneg()` to properly detect negative coefficients in both `Mul` and `MatMul` objects\n2. **Extraction**: Created `_get_positive_term()` to extract the positive part of negative terms without creating double negatives\n3. **Formatting**: Updated all three printers to use proper subtraction notation\n\n## Results\n\n**Before the fix:**\n```\nstr():    (-1)*B + (-1)*A*B + A\npprint(): -B + -A\u22c5B + A  \nlatex():  '-1 B + -1 A B + A'\n```\n\n**After the fix:**\n```\nstr():    -B - A*B + A\npprint(): -B - A\u22c5B + A\nlatex():  -B - A B + A\n```\n\nThe fix successfully eliminates the `(-1)*` notation and uses proper subtraction signs, making MatrixSymbol expressions much more readable and consistent with regular symbol behavior."}], "action": {"kind": "FinishAction", "message": "I have successfully implemented the necessary changes to fix the MatrixSymbol subtraction printing issue.
