Before the fix, line 84 was `return data` instead of `return to_native_string(data)`. This means that for string/bytes data, it was returned as-is without any conversion.\n\nThe fix for #2844 was specifically for URL parameters (the first usage on line 388), but it inadvertently affected the body data handling (the second usage on line 447).\n\nNow I understand the solution:\n\n**The fix should distinguish between the two use cases:**\n\n1. **For URL parameters** (line 388): We DO want to convert bytes to strings using `to_native_string`\n2. **For body data** (line 447): We should NOT convert bytes to strings - they should remain as bytes\n\nThe cleanest solution is to modify the `_encode_params` method to handle this distinction, or create a separate method for body data encoding.\n\nLooking at the logic more carefully, I think the best approach is to:\n\n1. Keep `_encode_params` as it was originally for body data (return bytes/strings as-is)\n2. Create a new method or modify the URL parameter handling to use `to_native_string` only when needed\n\nLet me check what the test for #2844 was expecting:"}], "action": {"kind": "ExecuteBashAction", "command": "cd /tmp/tmpa_yjin4u/requests && git show edc68a0a | grep -A 10 -B 5 \"test_params_bytes\"", "is_input": false}, "tool_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "toolu_011Uo66w7JSLpvzvqwwSLXPy", "tool_call": {"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"cd /tmp/tmpa_yjin4u/requests && git show edc68a0a | grep -A 10 -B 5 \\\"test_params_bytes\\\"\", \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_011Uo66w7JSLpvzvqwwSLXPy", "type": "function"}, "llm_response_id": "chatcmpl-4ea7d09b-da7b-468f-aea9-bcbf9426133e", "security_risk": "LOW"}
