Here's a comprehensive summary:\n\n### **Problem Analysis**\nThe issue was introduced in commit `edc68a0a` which changed the `_encode_params` method to call `to_native_string(data)` on all string/bytes data to fix issue #2844. However, this caused binary request body data like `u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\")` to fail with a `UnicodeDecodeError` when `to_native_string` tried to decode UTF-8 bytes using ASCII encoding.\n\n### **Root Cause**\nThe `_encode_params` method is used in two different contexts:\n1. **URL parameters** (line 388): Bytes need to be converted to strings \u2705\n2. **Request body data** (line 447): Bytes should remain as bytes \u274c\n\nThe original fix applied `to_native_string` to both contexts, breaking binary request bodies.\n\n### **Solution Implemented**\nI made **minimal, targeted changes** to `/tmp/tmpa_yjin4u/requests/requests/models.py`:\n\n1. **Reverted `_encode_params` method** (line 84):\n   - Changed `return to_native_string(data)` back to `return data`\n   - This preserves binary and string data as-is\n\n2. **Added URL parameter conversion** (lines 390-392):\n   - Added specific handling for bytes in URL parameters\n   - Only converts bytes to strings when building URLs (where it's needed)\n\n### **Changes Made**\n```python\n# Line 84: Reverted to preserve data types\nif isinstance(data, (str, bytes)):\n    return data  # Instead of: return to_native_string(data)\n\n# Lines 390-392: Added targeted conversion for URL parameters\nif enc_params:\n    # Convert bytes to string for URL parameters (fix for issue #2844)\n    if isinstance(enc_params, bytes):\n        enc_params = to_native_string(enc_params)\n```\n\n### **Verification Results**\n\u2705 **Original issue fixed**: `requests.put(\"http://httpbin.org/put\", data=u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\"))` now works  \n\u2705 **Issue #2844 compatibility maintained**: URL parameters with bytes still work correctly  \n\u2705 **All data types preserved**: Strings, bytes, file objects, and iterables handled properly  \n\u2705 **Minimal changes**: Only 2 lines changed, 3 lines added  \n\n### **Testing Performed**\n- Reproduced the original `UnicodeDecodeError` with the broken code\n- Verified the fix preserves binary data as bytes in request bodies\n- Confirmed URL parameters with bytes are still converted to strings\n- Tested edge cases with different data types\n\nThe fix is **production-ready** and maintains full backward compatibility while resolving the binary payload issue described in the issue description."}, "action_id": "b1cb42f0-377c-4cf7-aaeb-2f3056199f7d"}
