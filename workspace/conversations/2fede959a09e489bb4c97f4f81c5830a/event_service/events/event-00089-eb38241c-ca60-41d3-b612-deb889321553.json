VPacker is unchanged and continues to use the alignment directly.\n\n### Summary of Changes\n\n**Problem**: The `align` parameter in `HPacker` had reversed behavior for `\"top\"` and `\"bottom\"` values.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `_get_aligned_offsets` function was designed with VPacker's coordinate system in mind, where:\n- `\"left\"` and `\"top\"` map to small offsets\n- `\"right\"` and `\"bottom\"` map to large offsets\n\nThis works correctly for VPacker's horizontal alignment, but is backwards for HPacker's vertical alignment.\n\n**Solution**: Added a mapping in `HPacker.get_extent_offsets()` to swap `\"top\"` \u2194 `\"bottom\"` before calling `_get_aligned_offsets()`.\n\n**Changes Made**:\n1. **File**: `/tmp/tmpwumv_0e1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py`\n2. **Location**: Lines 478-484 in `HPacker.get_extent_offsets()` method\n3. **Change**: Added alignment mapping logic that swaps \"top\" and \"bottom\" for HPacker only\n4. **Impact**: \n   - \u2705 HPacker `align=\"bottom\"` now correctly aligns elements to the bottom\n   - \u2705 HPacker `align=\"top\"` now correctly aligns elements to the top\n   - \u2705 VPacker alignment remains unchanged and working correctly\n   - \u2705 Other alignments (\"center\", \"baseline\") are unaffected\n   - \u2705 All edge cases work correctly\n\n**Verification**: \n- Created comprehensive tests that confirm the fix works\n- Verified no regression in VPacker functionality\n- Tested edge cases (same height elements, elements with descent, single elements)\n- Confirmed the exact scenario from the original issue is now fixed\n\nThe fix is minimal, targeted, and addresses the exact issue described in the bug report without affecting any other functionality."}], "action": {"kind": "FinishAction", "message": "I have successfully implemented a fix for the HPacker alignment issue.
