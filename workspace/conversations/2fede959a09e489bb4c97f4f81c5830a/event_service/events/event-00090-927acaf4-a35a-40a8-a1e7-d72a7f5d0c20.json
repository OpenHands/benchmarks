Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe `align` parameter in `HPacker` had reversed behavior for `\"top\"` and `\"bottom\"` values. When `align=\"bottom\"` was specified, elements were aligned to the top, and vice versa.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe issue was in the shared `_get_aligned_offsets` function, which was designed with VPacker's coordinate system in mind. For VPacker (horizontal alignment), the logic works correctly, but for HPacker (vertical alignment), the meaning of \"top\" and \"bottom\" was backwards.\n\n## Solution Implemented\nI added a simple mapping in the `HPacker.get_extent_offsets()` method that swaps \"top\" \u2194 \"bottom\" before calling the shared `_get_aligned_offsets` function.\n\n**File Modified**: `/tmp/tmpwumv_0e1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py`\n**Lines**: 478-484\n\n**Code Added**:\n```python\n# For HPacker, we need to swap \"top\" and \"bottom\" alignment\n# because _get_aligned_offsets was designed for VPacker's coordinate system\nalign_map = {\"top\": \"bottom\", \"bottom\": \"top\"}\nmapped_align = align_map.get(self.align, self.align)\n```\n\n## Verification\nI created comprehensive tests that confirm:\n- \u2705 HPacker `align=\"bottom\"` now correctly aligns elements to the bottom\n- \u2705 HPacker `align=\"top\"` now correctly aligns elements to the top  \n- \u2705 VPacker alignment remains unchanged and working correctly\n- \u2705 Other alignments (\"center\", \"baseline\") are unaffected\n- \u2705 Edge cases work correctly (same height elements, elements with descent, single elements)\n- \u2705 The exact scenario from the original issue is now fixed\n\n## Impact\nThis is a minimal, targeted fix that addresses the exact issue described in the bug report without affecting any other functionality. The fix ensures that HPacker alignment behavior now matches user expectations while maintaining backward compatibility for all other use cases."}, "action_id": "eb38241c-ca60-41d3-b612-deb889321553"}
