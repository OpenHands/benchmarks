For `align in [\"left\", \"top\"]`: `offsets = [d for h, d in hd_list]` (line 171)\n2. For `align in [\"right\", \"bottom\"]`: `offsets = [height - h + d for h, d in hd_list]` (line 174)\n\nThe problem is in the HPacker class (line 478-480):\n```python\nheight, ydescent, yoffsets = _get_aligned_offsets(hd_list,\n                                                  self.height,\n                                                  self.align)\n```\n\nThe HPacker is using `_get_aligned_offsets` to align elements vertically (hence the variable names `height`, `ydescent`, `yoffsets`). However, the function treats \"top\" and \"bottom\" in a way that's confusing for horizontal packing.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- In HPacker, we're packing horizontally, so we need to align vertically\n- When we say `align=\"top\"` in HPacker, we want elements aligned to the top\n- When we say `align=\"bottom\"` in HPacker, we want elements aligned to the bottom\n\nLooking at the `_get_aligned_offsets` function:\n- For `align=\"top\"`: `offsets = [d for h, d in hd_list]` - this gives the descent values\n- For `align=\"bottom\"`: `offsets = [height - h + d for h, d in hd_list]` - this positions elements at the bottom\n\nThe issue is that in the context of HPacker:\n- \"top\" alignment should position elements at the top of the container\n- \"bottom\" alignment should position elements at the bottom of the container\n\nBut the current implementation seems to be doing the opposite. Let me verify this by looking at how the offsets are used and what coordinate system is being used.\n\nLooking at the VPacker (lines 449-450):\n```python\nydescent = height - yoffsets[0]\nyoffsets = height - yoffsets\n```\n\nThis suggests that the coordinate system has (0,0) at the bottom-left, and yoffsets are measured from the bottom. So:\n- For \"bottom\" alignment, elements should have small yoffsets (near the bottom)\n- For \"top\" alignment, elements should have large yoffsets (near the top)\n\nBut the current logic in `_get_aligned_offsets`:\n- For \"top\": gives small offsets (descent values)\n- For \"bottom\": gives large offsets (height - h + d)\n\nThis is backwards!
