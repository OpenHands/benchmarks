The latest version supports Python\n    36\t3.7.2 and above.\n    37\t\n    38\t.. _`static code analyser`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis\n    39\t\n    40\tPylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a\n    41\tcoding standard, looks for `code smells`_, and can make suggestions about how the code\n    42\tcould be refactored. Pylint can infer actual values from your code using its internal\n    43\tcode representation (astroid). If your code is ``import logging as argparse``, Pylint\n    44\twill know that ``argparse.error(...)`` is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call.\n    45\t\n    46\t.. _`code smells`: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html\n    47\t\n    48\tPylint is highly configurable and permits to write plugins in order to add your\n    49\town checks (for example, for internal libraries or an internal rule). Pylint has an\n    50\tecosystem of existing plugins for popular frameworks such as `pylint-django`_ or\n    51\t`pylint-sonarjson`_.\n    52\t\n    53\t.. _`pylint-django`: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django\n    54\t.. _`pylint-sonarjson`: https://github.com/omegacen/pylint-sonarjson\n    55\t\n    56\tPylint isn't smarter than you: it may warn you about things that you have\n    57\tconscientiously done or check for some things that you don't care about.\n    58\tDuring adoption, especially in a legacy project where pylint was never enforced,\n    59\tit's best to start with the ``--errors-only`` flag, then disable\n    60\tconvention and refactor message with ``--disable=C,R`` and progressively\n    61\tre-evaluate and re-enable messages as your priorities evolve.\n    62\t\n    63\tPylint ships with three additional tools:\n    64\t\n    65\t- pyreverse_ (standalone tool that generates package and class diagrams.)\n    66\t- symilar_  (duplicate code finder that is also integrated in pylint)\n    67\t- epylint_ (Emacs and Flymake compatible Pylint)\n    68\t\n    69\t.. _pyreverse: https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/pyreverse.html\n    70\t.. _symilar: https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/symilar.html\n    71\t.. _epylint: https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/ide_integration/flymake-emacs.html\n    72\t\n    73\tProjects that you might want to use alongside pylint include flake8_ (faster and simpler checks\n    74\twith very few false positives), mypy_, pyright_ or pyre_ (typing checks), bandit_ (security\n    75\toriented checks), black_ and isort_ (auto-formatting), autoflake_ (automated removal of\n    76\tunused imports or variables), pyupgrade_ (automated upgrade to newer python syntax) and\n    77\tpydocstringformatter_ (automated pep257).\n    78\t\n    79\t.. _flake8: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/\n    80\t.. _bandit: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit\n    81\t.. _mypy: https://github.com/python/mypy\n    82\t.. _pyright: https://github.com/microsoft/pyright\n    83\t.. _pyre: https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check\n    84\t.. _black: https://github.com/psf/black\n    85\t.. _autoflake: https://github.com/myint/autoflake\n    86\t.. _pyupgrade: https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade\n    87\t.. _pydocstringformatter: https://github.com/DanielNoord/pydocstringformatter\n    88\t.. _isort: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/\n    89\t\n    90\t..
