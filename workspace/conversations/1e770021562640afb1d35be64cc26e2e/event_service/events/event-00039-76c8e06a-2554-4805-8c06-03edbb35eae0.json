It doesn't matter whether the data originally\n  1230\t    came from a binary or ASCII table--the data should be passed in as a\n  1231\t    recarray.\n  1232\t\n  1233\t    `TableDataDiff` objects have the following diff attributes:\n  1234\t\n  1235\t    - ``diff_column_count``: If the tables being compared have different\n  1236\t      numbers of columns, this contains a 2-tuple of the column count in each\n  1237\t      table.  Even if the tables have different column counts, an attempt is\n  1238\t      still made to compare any columns they have in common.\n  1239\t\n  1240\t    - ``diff_columns``: If either table contains columns unique to that table,\n  1241\t      either in name or format, this contains a 2-tuple of lists. The first\n  1242\t      element is a list of columns (these are full `Column` objects) that\n  1243\t      appear only in table a.  The second element is a list of tables that\n  1244\t      appear only in table b.  This only lists columns with different column\n  1245\t      definitions, and has nothing to do with the data in those columns.\n  1246\t\n  1247\t    - ``diff_column_names``: This is like ``diff_columns``, but lists only the\n  1248\t      names of columns unique to either table, rather than the full `Column`\n  1249\t      objects.\n  1250\t\n  1251\t    - ``diff_column_attributes``: Lists columns that are in both tables but\n  1252\t      have different secondary attributes, such as TUNIT or TDISP.  The format\n  1253\t      is a list of 2-tuples: The first a tuple of the column name and the\n  1254\t      attribute, the second a tuple of the different values.\n  1255\t\n  1256\t    - ``diff_values``: `TableDataDiff` compares the data in each table on a\n  1257\t      column-by-column basis.  If any different data is found, it is added to\n  1258\t      this list.  The format of this list is similar to the ``diff_pixels``\n  1259\t      attribute on `ImageDataDiff` objects, though the \"index\" consists of a\n  1260\t      (column_name, row) tuple.
