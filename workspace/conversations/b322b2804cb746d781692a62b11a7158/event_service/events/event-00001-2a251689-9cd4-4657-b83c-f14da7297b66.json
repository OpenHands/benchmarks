Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nTimeSeries: misleading exception when required column check fails.\n<!-- This comments are hidden when you submit the issue,\r\nso you do not need to remove them! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please be sure to check out our contributing guidelines,\r\nhttps://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md .\r\nPlease be sure to check out our code of conduct,\r\nhttps://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md . -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please have a search on our GitHub repository to see if a similar\r\nissue has already been posted.\r\nIf a similar issue is closed, have a quick look to see if you are satisfied\r\nby the resolution.\r\nIf not please go ahead and open an issue! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check that the development version still produces the same bug.\r\nYou can install development version with\r\npip install git+https://github.com/astropy/astropy\r\ncommand. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!-- Provide a general description of the bug. -->\r\n\r\nFor a `TimeSeries` object that has additional required columns (in addition to `time`), when codes mistakenly try to remove a required column, the exception it produces is misleading.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- What did you expect to happen. -->\r\nAn exception that informs the users required columns are missing.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe actual exception message is confusing:\r\n`ValueError: TimeSeries object is invalid - expected 'time' as the first columns but found 'time'`\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!-- Ideally a code example could be provided so we can run it ourselves. -->\r\n<!-- If you are pasting code, use triple backticks (```) around\r\nyour code snippet. -->\r\n<!-- If necessary, sanitize your screen output to be pasted so you do not\r\nreveal secrets like tokens and passwords. -->\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom astropy.time import Time\r\nfrom astropy.timeseries import TimeSeries\r\n\r\ntime=Time(np.arange(100000, 100003), format='jd')\r\nts = TimeSeries(time=time, data = {\"flux\": [99.9, 99.8, 99.7]})\r\nts._required_columns = [\"time\", \"flux\"]                                   \r\nts.remove_column(\"flux\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System Details\r\n<!-- Even if you do not think this is necessary, it is useful information for the maintainers.\r\nPlease run the following snippet and paste the output below:\r\nimport platform; print(platform.platform())\r\nimport sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nimport numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nimport erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\nimport astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nimport scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nimport matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nWindows-10-10.0.22000-SP0\r\nPython 3.9.10 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Feb  1 2022, 21:21:54) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nNumpy 1.22.3\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.1\r\nastropy 5.0.3\r\nScipy 1.8.0\r\nMatplotlib 3.5.1\r\n```\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /tmp/tmpr5a8owwj/astropy directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 298ccb478e6bf092953bca67a3d29dc6c35f6752.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."}], "cache_enabled": false, "vision_enabled": false, "function_calling_enabled": false, "force_string_serializer": false}, "activated_microagents": [], "extended_content": []}
