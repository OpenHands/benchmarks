Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe issue was in the `_check_required_columns` method in `/tmp/tmpr5a8owwj/astropy/astropy/timeseries/core.py`. When a required column was missing (not just in the wrong position), the error message incorrectly stated \"expected 'time' as the first column but found 'time'\" which was confusing since 'time' was actually present.\n\n### Solution Implemented\n\n**Modified File:** `/tmp/tmpr5a8owwj/astropy/astropy/timeseries/core.py` (lines 77-92)\n\n**Key Changes:**\n1. **Enhanced Logic**: Added logic to distinguish between missing columns vs. wrong column order\n2. **Clear Error Messages**: When a required column is missing, the error now specifically states which column is missing\n3. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserved existing error messages for column ordering issues\n\n**New Logic Flow:**\n1. Check if any required columns are missing from the table\n2. If missing columns found \u2192 Report \"required column 'X' is missing\"  \n3.
