The problem is with the caplog fixture in pytest 6.0\n2. According to documentation, \"The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test\"\n3. This used to work in pytest < 6.0, but is broken in 6.0\n4. The minimal example shows:\n   - test_foo sets caplog level to 42\n   - test_bar prints caplog.handler.level\n   - In pytest < 6: prints \"0\" (level was restored)\n   - In pytest >= 6: prints \"42\" (level was NOT restored)\n\nKey technical details:\n- caplog fixture\n- caplog.set_level() method\n- caplog.handler.level property\n- Log level restoration between tests\n- Issue appeared in pytest 6.0 release\n\nThe problem is clear: the caplog fixture is not properly restoring the log level after each test completes, causing state to leak between tests.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create two test functions\n2. In first test, call caplog.set_level(42)\n3. In second test, check caplog.handler.level\n4. Expected: level should be restored to default (0)\n5. Actual: level remains at 42\n\nBest practices for fixing:\n- Ensure proper cleanup/teardown of test fixtures\n- Maintain test isolation\n- Follow pytest fixture lifecycle patterns\n- Make minimal changes to avoid breaking existing functionality"}, "tool_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_017dXCuDCi2QBQzRdis1Qfni", "tool_call": {"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"Let me analyze the issue description:\\n\\n1.
