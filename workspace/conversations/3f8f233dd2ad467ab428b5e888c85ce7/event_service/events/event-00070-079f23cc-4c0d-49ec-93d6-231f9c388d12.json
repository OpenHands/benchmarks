Current ITRS transformations to AltAz/HADec go through complex paths (ITRS->CIRS->ICRS->AltAz) that involve aberration corrections and SSB referencing\n2. For nearby objects (satellites, aircraft, buildings), this causes the ITRS coordinates to be displaced by millions of kilometers when different obstimes are used\n3. The issue is that ITRS->ITRS transforms reference coordinates to the Solar System Barycenter instead of keeping them tied to Earth\n\n**Solution Approach:**\n1. Implement direct ITRS->AltAz and ITRS->HADec transformations that stay within the ITRS frame\n2. Treat ITRS coordinates as time-invariant (adopt the obstime of the output frame)\n3. Use simple rotation matrices based on observer location (longitude, latitude)\n4. Handle the left-handed coordinate systems correctly (AltAz and HADec are both left-handed)\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n1. Create `itrs_to_observed_mat()` function to generate transformation matrices\n2. Create `itrs_to_observed()` and `observed_to_itrs()` transformation functions\n3. Register these transformations with the frame_transform_graph\n4. The transformations should be added to a new file or to the existing intermediate_rotation_transforms.py\n\n**Key Technical Points:**\n- AltAz frame is left-handed (needs minus_x matrix)\n- HADec frame is left-handed (needs minus_y matrix)  \n- Use rotation matrices with longitude (elong) and latitude (elat) from observer location\n- Transform topocentric ITRS position using the matrices\n- No aberration corrections or complex astronomical calculations needed\n\n**File Location:**\nBased on the code structure, the best place to add these transformations would be in the intermediate_rotation_transforms.py file since:\n1.
