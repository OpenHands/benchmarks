So the structure is similar, but `np.where` returns a numpy array while the VLA code returns a list. This should be fine for most operations, but there might be a subtle issue.\n\nNow let me think about what could cause the false positive. Let me look more carefully at the VLA comparison logic. The issue might be in how VLA data is actually stored or accessed. Let me try to create a more realistic test that simulates the actual FITS VLA data structure.\n\nLet me look at how VLA data is actually represented in FITS:"}], "action": {"kind": "ExecuteBashAction", "command": "cd /tmp/tmpzv9aq_xa/astropy && grep -r -A 10 -B 5 \"_VLF\\|VLF\" astropy/io/fits/ --include=\"*.py\"", "is_input": false}, "tool_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "toolu_011voGY3GD2RP5HBjKX8w5Jn", "tool_call": {"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"cd /tmp/tmpzv9aq_xa/astropy && grep -r -A 10 -B 5 \\\"_VLF\\\\|VLF\\\" astropy/io/fits/ --include=\\\"*.py\\\"\", \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_011voGY3GD2RP5HBjKX8w5Jn", "type": "function"}, "llm_response_id": "chatcmpl-9560e1c7-642e-4c8d-9bc7-980388626b91", "security_risk": "LOW"}
