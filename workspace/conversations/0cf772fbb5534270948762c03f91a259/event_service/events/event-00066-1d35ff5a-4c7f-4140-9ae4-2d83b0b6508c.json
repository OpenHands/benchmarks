Let me trace through the logic:\n\n1. For the nested compound model `Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm`, the `_separable` function is called\n2. Since it's a CompoundModel, it calls `_separable` on both left (Pix2Sky_TAN) and right (cm) parts\n3.

For the right part (cm), it should return the separability matrix of the compound model cm\n\nThe issue seems to be in the `_cstack` function when it handles the right side. Let me look at the `_cstack` function more carefully:\n\n```python\ndef _cstack(left, right):\n    noutp = _compute_n_outputs(left, right)\n\n    if isinstance(left, Model):\n        cleft = _coord_matrix(left, 'left', noutp)\n    else:\n        cleft = np.zeros((noutp, left.shape[1]))\n        cleft[: left.shape[0], : left.shape[1]] = left\n    if isinstance(right, Model):\n        cright = _coord_matrix(right, 'right', noutp)\n    else:\n        cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\n        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1  # This line looks suspicious\n\n    return np.hstack([cleft, cright])\n```\n\nThe problem is in the `else` branch for the right side. When `right` is not a Model (i.e., it's already a separability matrix from a nested compound model), the code sets `cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1`, which fills the bottom-right corner with 1s instead of copying the actual separability matrix.\n\nThis is the bug!
