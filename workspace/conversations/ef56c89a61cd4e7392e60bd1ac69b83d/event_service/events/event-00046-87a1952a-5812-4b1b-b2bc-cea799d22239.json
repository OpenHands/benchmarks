In `_get_aligned_offsets` function (lines 169-174):\n   - For `align in [\"left\", \"top\"]`: offsets = [d for h, d in hd_list]\n   - For `align in [\"right\", \"bottom\"]`: offsets = [height - h + d for h, d in hd_list]\n\n2. The function is used by both HPacker and VPacker:\n   - VPacker uses it for horizontal alignment (left/right/center)\n   - HPacker uses it for vertical alignment (top/bottom/center)\n\n3. The issue is in the coordinate system interpretation:\n   - In matplotlib, the coordinate system has (0,0) at the bottom-left\n   - For vertical alignment in HPacker:\n     - \"top\" should align elements to the top of the container\n     - \"bottom\" should align elements to the bottom of the container\n   \n4.

The problem is that the logic is reversed:\n   - When align=\"bottom\", we want elements aligned to the bottom, but the current code positions them at the top\n   - When align=\"top\", we want elements aligned to the top, but the current code positions them at the bottom\n\n6. Looking at the HPacker usage in line 478:\n   ```python\n   height, ydescent, yoffsets = _get_aligned_offsets(hd_list, self.height, self.align)\n   ```\n   The yoffsets are used directly as vertical positions.\n\n7.
