The issue is about a request with binary payload failing due to calling `to_native_string`\n2. It was introduced with issue #2844 \n3. The failing code is: `requests.put(\"http://httpbin.org/put\", data=u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\"))`\n4. This worked in version 2.8.1 but fails in 2.9\n\nKey technical details:\n- Method: `to_native_string` is being called inappropriately on binary data\n- The data is UTF-8 encoded bytes from a Unicode string with non-ASCII characters\n- This suggests the issue is in how the library handles binary vs text data\n\nThe problem seems to be that somewhere in the code, binary data (bytes) is being passed to a function that expects or tries to convert it to a native string, which would fail for binary data.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a Unicode string with non-ASCII characters: `u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\"`\n2. Encode it to UTF-8 bytes: `.encode(\"utf-8\")`\n3. Send it as data in a PUT request: `requests.put(\"http://httpbin.org/put\", data=...)`\n4. The request should fail in version 2.9 but work in 2.8.1\n\nBest practices for fixing:\n- Need to identify where `to_native_string` is being called on binary data\n- Should preserve binary data as-is when it's meant to be binary\n- Need to distinguish between text data (that should be converted) and binary data (that should not)"}, "tool_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01GNX9cLnG1CNC5312sLBofz", "tool_call": {"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"Let me analyze the issue description:\\n\\n1.
