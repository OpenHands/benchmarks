In February 2007,\n   198\tFabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fixed many things, contributed\n   199\tdocumentation and made it alive again. 5 students (Mateusz Paprocki, Brian\n   200\tJorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz and Chris Wu) improved SymPy incredibly\n   201\tduring the summer 2007 as part of the Google Summer of Code. Pearu Peterson\n   202\tjoined the development during the summer 2007 and he has made SymPy much more\n   203\tcompetitive by rewriting the core from scratch, that has made it from 10x to\n   204\t100x faster. Jurjen N.E. Bos has contributed pretty printing and other patches.\n   205\tFredrik Johansson has written mpmath and contributed a lot of patches.\n   206\t\n   207\tSymPy has participated in every Google Summer of Code since 2007. You can see\n   208\thttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki#google-summer-of-code for full details.\n   209\tEach year has improved SymPy by bounds. Most of SymPy's development has come\n   210\tfrom Google Summer of Code students.\n   211\t\n   212\tIn 2011, Ond\u0159ej \u010cert\u00edk stepped down as lead developer, with Aaron Meurer, who\n   213\talso started as a Google Summer of Code student, taking his place. Ond\u0159ej\n   214\t\u010cert\u00edk is still active in the community, but is too busy with work and family\n   215\tto play a lead development role.\n   216\t\n   217\tSince then, a lot more people have joined the development and some people have\n   218\talso left. You can see the full list in doc/src/aboutus.rst, or online at:\n   219\t\n   220\thttp://docs.sympy.org/dev/aboutus.html#sympy-development-team\n   221\t\n   222\tThe git history goes back to 2007, when development moved from svn to hg.  To\n   223\tsee the history before that point, look at http://github.com/sympy/sympy-old.\n   224\t\n   225\tYou can use git to see the biggest developers.
