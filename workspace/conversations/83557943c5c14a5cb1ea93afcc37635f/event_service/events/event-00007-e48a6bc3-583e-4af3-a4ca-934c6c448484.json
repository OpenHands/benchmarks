This repository contains the core package which is\n    12\tintended to contain much of the core functionality and some common tools needed\n    13\tfor performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.\n    14\t\n    15\tReleases are `registered on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/astropy>`_,\n    16\tand development is occurring at the\n    17\t`project's GitHub page <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.\n    18\t\n    19\tFor installation instructions, see the `online documentation <https://docs.astropy.org/>`_\n    20\tor  `docs/install.rst <docs/install.rst>`_ in this source distribution.\n    21\t\n    22\tContributing Code, Documentation, or Feedback\n    23\t---------------------------------------------\n    24\t\n    25\tThe Astropy Project is made both by and for its users, so we welcome and\n    26\tencourage contributions of many kinds. Our goal is to keep this a positive,\n    27\tinclusive, successful, and growing community by abiding with the\n    28\t`Astropy Community Code of Conduct <http://www.astropy.org/about.html#codeofconduct>`_.\n    29\t\n    30\tMore detailed information on contributing to the project or submitting feedback\n    31\tcan be found on the `contributions <http://www.astropy.org/contribute.html>`_\n    32\tpage.

None of the Astropy build machinery depends on it, but it is a convenient way to quickly get started doing development on Astropy.\n    40\t\n    41\tTo get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this \ud83d\udc47\n    42\t\n    43\t|Codespaces|\n    44\t\n    45\tA codespace will open in a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. The `dev container <.devcontainer/devcontainer.json>`_ is fully configured with software needed for this project. Feel free to take a look at `GitHub Codespaces Support <https://support.github.com/features/codespaces>`_ page for help.\n    46\t\n    47\t**Note**: Dev containers is an open spec which is supported by `GitHub Codespaces <https://github.com/codespaces>`_ and `other tools <https://containers.dev/supporting>`_.\n    48\t\n    49\tSupporting the Project\n    50\t----------------------\n    51\t\n    52\t|NumFOCUS| |Donate|\n    53\t\n    54\tThe Astropy Project is sponsored by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the\n    55\tUnited States.
