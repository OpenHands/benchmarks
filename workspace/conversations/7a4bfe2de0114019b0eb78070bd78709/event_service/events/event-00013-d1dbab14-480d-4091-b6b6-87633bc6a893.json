Each\n    51\tmethod invokes `pytest`_ to run the tests but offers different options when\n    52\tcalling. To run the tests, you will need to make sure you have the `pytest`_\n    53\tpackage installed.\n    54\t\n    55\tIn addition to running the Astropy tests, these methods can also be called\n    56\tso that they check Python source code for `PEP8 compliance\n    57\t<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. All of the PEP8 testing\n    58\toptions require the `pytest-pep8 plugin\n    59\t<https://pypi.org/project/pytest-pep8>`_, which must be installed\n    60\tseparately.\n    61\t\n    62\t\n    63\ttox\n    64\t===\n    65\t\n    66\tThe most robust way to run the tests (which can also be the slowest) is\n    67\tto make use of `Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, which is a\n    68\tgeneral purpose tool for automating Python testing. One of the benefits of tox\n    69\tis that it first creates a source distribution of the package being tested, and\n    70\tinstalls it into a new virtual environment, along with any dependencies that are\n    71\tdeclared in the package, before running the tests. This can therefore catch\n    72\tissues related to undeclared package data, or missing dependencies. Since we use\n    73\ttox to run many of the tests on continuous integration services, it can also be\n    74\tused in many cases to reproduce issues seen on those services.\n    75\t\n    76\tTo run the tests with tox, first make sure that tox is installed, e.g.::\n    77\t\n    78\t    pip install tox\n    79\t\n    80\tthen run the basic test suite with::\n    81\t\n    82\t    tox -e test\n    83\t\n    84\tor run the test suite with all optional dependencies with::\n    85\t\n    86\t    tox -e test-alldeps\n    87\t\n    88\tYou can see a list of available test environments with::\n    89\t\n    90\t    tox -l -v\n    91\t\n    92\twhich will also explain what each of them does.\n    93\t\n    94\tYou can also run checks or commands not directly related to tests - for instance::\n    95\t\n    96\t    tox -e codestyle\n    97\t\n    98\twill run checks using the ``ruff`` tool.\n    99\t\n   100\t.. note::\n", "path": "/tmp/tmp1_6k5dg_/astropy/docs/development/testguide.rst", "prev_exist": true}, "action_id": "51aaa5f4-bce1-42d6-985a-e65250fae08c"}
