I found the issue. The problem is that when using `np.where(arra != arrb)` on VLA data (which has dtype `object` and contains numpy arrays), it fails with the error \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\"\n\nThis explains the original bug: the code was trying to use `np.where(arra != arrb)` on VLA data, which would fail or produce incorrect results.\n\nThe fix should be to include \"Q\" format columns (which are VLA columns) in the VLA-specific comparison logic, not just \"P\" format columns.\n\nLet me check what the current logic should be. Let me look at the FITS standard to understand VLA formats:"}], "action": {"kind": "ExecuteBashAction", "command": "cd /tmp/tmp1_6k5dg_/astropy && grep -r -n \"Q.*format\\|variable.*length\" astropy/io/fits/ | grep -v test | grep -v __pycache__ | head -10", "is_input": false}, "tool_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01UvTWu9dSSDgUrw4KtqZQkr", "tool_call": {"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"cd /tmp/tmp1_6k5dg_/astropy && grep -r -n \\\"Q.*format\\\\|variable.*length\\\" astropy/io/fits/ | grep -v test | grep -v __pycache__ | head -10\", \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_01UvTWu9dSSDgUrw4KtqZQkr", "type": "function"}, "llm_response_id": "chatcmpl-e805945c-354f-4f26-82fb-2144a43c3ad1", "security_risk": "LOW"}
