Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. **Simple compound model works correctly**: `cm = Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)` produces the correct diagonal separability matrix `[[True, False], [False, True]]`.\n\n2. **Complex model works correctly**: `Pix2Sky_TAN() & Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)` (which is `((Pix2Sky_TAN() & Linear1D(10)) & Linear1D(5))` due to left-associativity) produces the correct block diagonal matrix.\n\n3. **Nested model fails**: `Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` produces an incorrect matrix where the bottom-right 2x2 block is all True instead of being diagonal.\n\nFrom the debug output, I can see:\n- `_separable(nested_model.left)` returns `[[1. 1.], [1. 1.]]` for Pix2Sky_TAN() (correct - it's non-separable)\n- `_separable(nested_model.right)` returns `[[1. 0.], [0. 1.]]` for the compound model `cm` (correct - it's diagonal)\n- But `_cstack(sepleft, sepright)` returns `[[1. 1. 0. 0.], [1. 1. 0. 0.], [0. 0. 1. 1.], [0. 0. 1. 1.]]` (incorrect - the bottom-right should be diagonal)\n\nThe problem is in the `_cstack` function! When it processes the right operand (which is a compound model), it's not handling it correctly. Let me look at the `_cstack` function more carefully:\n\n```python\ndef _cstack(left, right):\n    noutp = _compute_n_outputs(left, right)\n\n    if isinstance(left, Model):\n        cleft = _coord_matrix(left, 'left', noutp)\n    else:\n        cleft = np.zeros((noutp, left.shape[1]))\n        cleft[: left.shape[0], : left.shape[1]] = left\n    if isinstance(right, Model):\n        cright = _coord_matrix(right, 'right', noutp)\n    else:\n        cright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\n        cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1  # <-- BUG IS HERE!\n\n    return np.hstack([cleft, cright])\n```\n\nThe bug is in the `else` clause for the right operand! When `right` is not a Model (i.e., it's already a separability matrix from a nested compound model), the code sets `cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1`, which fills the bottom-right corner with all 1s instead of copying the actual separability matrix.\n\nIt should be:\n```python\ncright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right\n```\n\nThis is the fix!"}, "tool_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_014hDqsHa3nL9BDA7PMtBvEU", "tool_call": {"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"Now I can clearly see the issue!
