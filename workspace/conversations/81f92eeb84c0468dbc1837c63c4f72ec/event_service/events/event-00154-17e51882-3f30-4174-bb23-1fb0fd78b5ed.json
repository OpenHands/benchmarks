My simulation shows that the basic `np.allclose` comparison actually works fine in these test cases. This suggests that the issue might be more subtle and related to how the actual FITS data is loaded and structured.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The issue might not be in the comparison logic itself, but in how the VLA data is structured when loaded from FITS files.
