This is very revealing. The `vlf1 == vlf2` comparison fails with the \"ambiguous truth value\" error, but the individual element comparisons with `np.allclose` work fine. This suggests that the issue might not be in the element-wise comparison logic in the diff.py file, but somewhere else.\n\nHowever, I notice that my simulation still doesn't reproduce the exact bug. Let me think about this more carefully. The issue might be more subtle and related to how the data is actually structured when loaded from FITS files.\n\nLet me look at the issue description again and try to understand what might be different. The issue mentions that the problem occurs when comparing the same file to itself, which suggests that the issue is in how the data is loaded or compared at a higher level.\n\nLet me examine the diff.py code more carefully to see if there are other potential issues:"}], "action": {"kind": "StrReplaceEditorAction", "command": "view", "path": "/tmp/tmpvq5i4eh4/astropy/astropy/io/fits/diff.py", "view_range": [1440, 1480]}, "tool_name": "str_replace_editor", "tool_call_id": "toolu_012o4q6Gw3Yh2tHRqV9ctxMu", "tool_call": {"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/tmp/tmpvq5i4eh4/astropy/astropy/io/fits/diff.py\", \"view_range\": [1440, 1480], \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_012o4q6Gw3Yh2tHRqV9ctxMu", "type": "function"}, "llm_response_id": "chatcmpl-269caeac-2a91-4833-bc95-1c1a6ecaee27", "security_risk": "LOW"}
