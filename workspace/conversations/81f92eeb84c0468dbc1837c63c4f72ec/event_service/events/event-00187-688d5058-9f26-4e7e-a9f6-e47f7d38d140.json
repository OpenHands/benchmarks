However, I've learned a lot about the potential sources of the problem. Let me take a step back and think about this differently.\n\nSince I can't easily reproduce the exact bug, let me focus on implementing a robust fix based on the analysis I've done. The key insight is that the VLA comparison logic in diff.py could be made more robust to handle edge cases that might cause `np.allclose` to fail or behave unexpectedly.\n\nBased on my analysis, I believe the issue is likely in the VLA comparison logic in diff.py, and the fix should make the comparison more robust.
