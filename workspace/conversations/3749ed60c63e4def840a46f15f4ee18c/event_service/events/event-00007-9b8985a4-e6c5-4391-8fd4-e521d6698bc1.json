It was originally created\n    40\tfor the new Python documentation, and has excellent facilities for Python\n    41\tproject documentation, but C/C++ is supported as well, and more languages are\n    42\tplanned.\n    43\t\n    44\tSphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths\n    45\tcome from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing\n    46\tand translating suite, the Docutils.\n    47\t\n    48\tAmong its features are the following:\n    49\t\n    50\t* Output formats: HTML (including derivative formats such as HTML Help, Epub\n    51\t  and Qt Help), plain text, manual pages and LaTeX or direct PDF output\n    52\t  using rst2pdf\n    53\t* Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links\n    54\t  for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information\n    55\t* Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic\n    56\t  links to siblings, parents and children\n    57\t* Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index\n    58\t* Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter\n    59\t* Flexible HTML output using the Jinja 2 templating engine\n    60\t* Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of snippets\n    61\t  and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings\n    62\t* Setuptools integration\n    63\t\n    64\tFor more information, refer to the `the documentation`__.\n    65\t\n    66\t.. __: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/\n    67\t\n    68\tInstallation\n    69\t============\n    70\t\n    71\tSphinx is published on `PyPI`__ and can be installed from there::\n    72\t\n    73\t   pip install -U sphinx\n    74\t\n    75\tWe also publish beta releases::\n    76\t\n    77\t   pip install -U --pre sphinx\n    78\t\n    79\tIf you wish to install `Sphinx` for development purposes, refer to `the\n    80\tcontributors guide`__.\n    81\t\n    82\t__ https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/\n    83\t__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/internals/contributing.html\n    84\t\n    85\tDocumentation\n    86\t=============\n    87\t\n    88\tDocumentation is available from `sphinx-doc.org`__.\n    89\t\n    90\t__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/\n    91\t\n    92\tGet in touch\n    93\t============\n    94\t\n    95\t- Report bugs, suggest features or view the source code `on GitHub`_.\n    96\t- For less well defined questions or ideas, use the `mailing list`_.\n    97\t\n    98\t.. _on GitHub: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx\n    99\t.. _mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sphinx-users\n   100\t\n   101\tPlease adhere to our `code of conduct`__.\n   102\t\n   103\t__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/code_of_conduct.html\n   104\t\n   105\tTesting\n   106\t=======\n   107\t\n   108\tContinuous testing is provided by `Travis`__ (for unit tests and style checks\n   109\ton Linux), `AppVeyor`__ (for unit tests on Windows), and `CircleCI`__ (for\n   110\tlarge processes like TeX compilation).\n   111\t\n   112\tFor information on running tests locally, refer to `the contributors guide`__.\n   113\t\n   114\t__ https://travis-ci.org/sphinx-doc/sphinx\n   115\t__ https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sphinxdoc/sphinx\n   116\t__ https://circleci.com/gh/sphinx-doc/sphinx\n   117\t__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/internals/contributing.html\n   118\t\n   119\tContributing\n   120\t============\n   121\t\n   122\tRefer to `the contributors guide`__.\n   123\t\n   124\t__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/internals/contributing.html\n   125\t\n   126\tRelease signatures\n   127\t==================\n   128\t\n   129\tReleases are signed with following keys:\n   130\t\n   131\t* `498D6B9E <https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x102C2C17498D6B9E>`_\n   132\t* `5EBA0E07 <https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x1425F8CE5EBA0E07>`_\n   133\t\n", "path": "/tmp/tmpckii7xuk/sphinx/README.rst", "prev_exist": true}, "action_id": "f8580309-5536-42e8-a960-af2fe0c3b653"}
