The HTML output should show \"1.24e-24\" and \"3.23e-15\" but instead shows the full precision numbers.\n\n4. **Root cause**: The HTML writer calls `col.info.iter_str_vals()` directly, which bypasses the formatting mechanism. Other formats like CSV and RST work because they use the standard `BaseReader.write()` method which calls `self.data.write()` which in turn calls `self.str_vals()` that applies the formatting via `_set_col_formats()`.\n\n**Best practices to consider in the fix:**\n1. **Minimal change**: We should modify the HTML writer to use the same formatting mechanism as other writers.\n2. **Consistency**: The fix should make HTML writer behave consistently with other ASCII writers.\n3. **Backward compatibility**: The fix should not break existing functionality.\n4. **Code reuse**: We should reuse existing formatting infrastructure rather than reimplementing it.\n\n**How to fix the problem:**\nThe HTML writer needs to apply column formatting before generating the string values.
