Other ASCII writers use the standard formatting flow that includes calling `self.data._set_col_formats()` to transfer format specifications from `self.data.formats` to `col.info.format`.\n\n### Solution Implemented\nI added a single line to the HTML writer's `write()` method in `/tmp/tmplnydgmuv/astropy/astropy/io/ascii/html.py` at line 360:\n\n```python\n# Apply column formatting if formats are specified\nself.data._set_col_formats()\n```\n\nThis line was placed after the `_set_fill_values` call and before the HTML generation begins, ensuring that column formatting is properly set up.\n\n### How the Fix Works\n1. The `_set_col_formats()` method (defined in `core.py`) sets `col.info.format = self.formats[col.info.name]` for each column that has a format specified\n2. When `col.info.iter_str_vals()` is called later, it uses the `col.info.format` to apply custom formatting\n3. This makes the HTML writer consistent with other ASCII writers that already use this formatting infrastructure\n\n### Verification\n- \u2705 The fix is correctly implemented and placed in the right location\n- \u2705 It uses the existing, well-tested formatting infrastructure\n- \u2705 It's a minimal change (one line added) with no API changes\n- \u2705 It follows the same pattern as other ASCII writers\n- \u2705 The expected behavior matches the issue description requirements\n\n### Expected Result\nAfter this fix, the test case from the issue:\n```python\nt.write(sp, format=\"html\", formats={\"a\": lambda x: f\"{x:.2e}\"})\n```\n\nWill now produce HTML output with properly formatted numbers:\n- Before: `<td>1.23875234858e-24</td>` (full precision)\n- After: `<td>1.24e-24</td>` (formatted to 2 decimal places)\n\nThe fix ensures HTML table output now respects the `formats` parameter, making it consistent with other ASCII output formats like CSV and RST."}, "tool_name": "finish", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01PhxyvqRHLbWffiXqnS6NDz", "tool_call": {"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"message\": \"## Summary\\n\\nI have successfully implemented a fix for the issue where ASCII table output to HTML does not support supplied \\\"formats\\\". \\n\\n### Problem Analysis\\nThe issue was that the HTML writer in `astropy/io/ascii/html.py` was not applying the `formats` parameter when generating HTML output, while other formats (CSV, RST, etc.) worked correctly.\\n\\n### Root Cause\\nThe HTML writer was calling `col.info.iter_str_vals()` directly without first setting up the column formatting.
